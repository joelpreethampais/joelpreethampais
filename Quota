To delete interconnects in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), follow these steps:

	1.	Access the Google Cloud Console:
	•	Go to the Google Cloud Console and log in with your credentials.
	2.	Navigate to the Interconnect Section:
	•	In the Google Cloud Console, click on the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner.
	•	Go to Hybrid Connectivity and select Interconnects.
	3.	Select the Interconnect:
	•	Find the interconnect you want to delete. You might need to select the appropriate project or region if you have multiple.
	•	Click on the interconnect to open its details.
	4.	Delete Associated VLAN Attachments (If Necessary):
	•	If there are any VLAN attachments (also known as Interconnect Attachments) associated with the interconnect, you need to delete them first.
	•	Go to Hybrid Connectivity > Interconnect Attachments (VLANs), select the relevant VLAN attachments, and delete them.
	5.	Delete the Interconnect:
	•	After deleting the VLAN attachments, return to the Interconnects section.
	•	Select the interconnect you want to delete.
	•	Click on the Delete button or select Delete from the actions menu.
	6.	Confirm Deletion:
	•	Confirm that you want to delete the interconnect. Be aware that this action cannot be undone.
	7.	Wait for the Deletion Process to Complete:
	•	The deletion process might take some time, depending on the resources involved.
	8.	Verify Deletion:
	•	Ensure that the interconnect and any associated resources (like VLAN attachments) have been deleted by refreshing the page or checking the resources in the Interconnects and Interconnect Attachments (VLANs) sections.

Once these steps are completed, the interconnect and its associated resources will be fully removed from your GCP project.
