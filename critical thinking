1. Architecture & Network Foundation

How will on-prem Terraform servers securely reach BlueCat in the NCC Hub (VPN, Interconnect, Private Service Connect, or NAT)?

Is BlueCat running in a high-availability pair or just a single VM?

If single: what‚Äôs the plan for backup, restore, and failover?

Will NCC Hub use Private Service Connect to expose BlueCat APIs privately to all spokes?

How will BlueCat integrate with VPC Service Controls and organization policies in GCP?

Is BlueCat licensed for the expected subnet and IP growth across all environments (sandbox, nonprod, prod)?

‚öôÔ∏è 2. BlueCat API & Terraform Integration

Are you using official BlueCat Terraform provider or custom REST API modules?

What‚Äôs the auth method (basic, token, or OAuth) ‚Äî and how will secrets be managed (Secret Manager, Vault)?

Is the Terraform provider thread-safe for concurrent pipelines (to prevent IP conflicts)?

What‚Äôs the rate limit and timeout behavior for BlueCat API calls?

How does Terraform handle retries if BlueCat API is slow/unavailable?

How do you plan to mock/test IPAM API locally without affecting live data?

üß± 3. State & Data Consistency

Where is Terraform state stored (local on-prem, Cloud Storage, or Terraform Cloud)?

How is state locking handled when multiple teams deploy at once?

How will you ensure BlueCat IP allocation data stays consistent with GCP (e.g., subnets deleted manually in GCP)?

Will you implement periodic reconciliation (e.g., weekly job to verify IP consistency)?

What happens if a Terraform plan fails midway ‚Äî are IPs rolled back in BlueCat?

üß∞ 4. Reliability & Recovery

If the BlueCat VM or API becomes unavailable, can Terraform deployments continue using cached IP pools?

What‚Äôs your disaster recovery plan ‚Äî snapshot/replication strategy for BlueCat DB?

How do you handle duplicate IP allocation if two pipelines run in parallel?

Are there health checks and uptime monitoring (e.g., Cloud Monitoring + alerting for API downtime)?

Is the BlueCat API behind a load balancer for HA?

üåê 5. Security & Governance

How are you securing BlueCat API endpoints (private IP only, IAM, firewall rules)?

How are credentials stored and rotated (Secret Manager, Vault)?

Will you enforce RBAC or Terraform workspaces per environment?

Who owns IP space delegation ‚Äî BlueCat admins or Terraform owners?

How will audit logs be collected (e.g., Cloud Logging + on-prem SIEM integration)?

üì¶ 6. Scalability

What‚Äôs the projected subnet/IP growth in the next 12 months?

Can BlueCat handle concurrent subnet allocation requests from multiple Terraform runs?

Will NCC Hub need to scale its VM size or use a managed database backend?

How will you handle multi-region IP pools (centralized or per region)?

üß™ 7. Testing & Validation

How will you test next-available IP allocation in nonprod safely?

Can you simulate API throttling or network latency to test resilience?

Do you have integration tests that check BlueCat ‚Üí Terraform ‚Üí GCP end-to-end?

Will you enforce pre-commit hooks or Terraform plan validation in CI/CD?

üöÄ 8. CI/CD & Automation

How will you trigger Terraform plans ‚Äî manually, GitOps (PR-based), or scheduled?

How will you ensure environment separation (workspace, project, or folder-level)?

Are deployments idempotent ‚Äî running the same plan twice should cause no change.

Do you plan to version control IPAM data (e.g., YAML manifests describing IP blocks)?

What‚Äôs the rollback process if a network provisioning fails?

üìä 9. Observability

Will BlueCat API logs be exported to Cloud Logging or Splunk?

Do you have dashboards to track IP pool utilization and subnet creation rate?

Can you correlate Terraform state changes with IPAM events?

How will you detect orphaned or stale IPs?

üß≠ 10. Future Readiness

If Terraform moves to Cloud Workstations or Cloud Build, how does connectivity to BlueCat evolve?

Can this model be extended to manage DNS or DHCP from BlueCat too?

Could you abstract IPAM behind a custom internal API layer (for other automation tools)?

What‚Äôs your upgrade plan when BlueCat or its Terraform provider version changes?
