A bank wants to detect potential fraudulent transactions in real-time. Whenever a transaction occurs (e.g., a credit card purchase or a wire transfer), the transaction data is sent to Google Cloud for processing. Cloud Functions can receive this data, perform basic fraud checks, and store the results in BigQuery, where further analysis and auditing can take place, all within a private network to ensure data security and compliance.
