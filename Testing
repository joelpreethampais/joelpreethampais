**Title**: Create Detailed MACsec Test Plan in GCP

**Description**:  
We need to design and document a comprehensive test plan to validate MACsec (Media Access Control Security) functionality within our GCP environment. This plan will serve as the foundation for ensuring secure Layer 2 encryption over supported interfaces and help identify any gaps or misconfigurations.

The test plan should cover:

- Overview of MACsec and its relevance in our architecture  
- GCP prerequisites and supported configurations for MACsec  
- Detailed test scenarios including:  
  - Interface and VPC configuration  
  - Enabling and validating MACsec on supported instances  
  - Positive test cases (e.g., successful encryption, secure communication)  
  - Negative test cases (e.g., misconfiguration, dropped packets)  
- Validation steps and expected outcomes  
- Troubleshooting guidance for common issues  
- Tools and scripts to be used for validation  
- Logging and monitoring considerations  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A detailed and version-controlled MACsec test plan document is created and reviewed  
- Test scenarios include both positive and negative cases  
- Validation steps are clear and repeatable  
- Aligned with current GCP MACsec support and documentation
