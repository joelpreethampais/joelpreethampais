Sure! Here's a Jira story description tailored for discovering MACsec features:

**Title**: Perform Discovery of MACsec Features in GCP

**Description**:  
We need to perform a thorough discovery of MACsec (Media Access Control Security) features available in Google Cloud Platform. This effort will help us understand the current capabilities, limitations, and prerequisites for implementing MACsec in our environment. The findings from this discovery will guide the design of our MACsec test plan and implementation strategy.

Scope of discovery includes:

- Identify GCP products and network interfaces that support MACsec  
- Understand configuration options and available APIs/CLI commands  
- Review official GCP documentation, release notes, and support articles  
- Gather information on prerequisites, such as supported VM types, NIC types, and OS/kernel versions  
- Determine monitoring and troubleshooting tools available for MACsec  
- Capture details on performance impact, encryption standards used, and integration with other GCP security features  
- Document any known limitations, caveats, or best practices  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A discovery document is created summarizing all findings  
- Information is verified against official GCP sources  
- Relevant links to documentation and tools are included  
- Output is reviewed and approved for use in the MACsec test plan

Let me know if you want this to include competitive analysis (e.g., how MACsec is handled in AWS/Azure) or if it's GCP-only.
