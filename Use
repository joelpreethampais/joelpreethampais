Here is an example query to track source IP addresses before and after NAT translation:

SELECT
  JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.src_ip') AS internal_ip,
  JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.dest_ip') AS destination_ip,
  JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.nat_ip') AS external_ip,
  JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.src_port') AS source_port,
  JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.dest_port') AS destination_port,
  timestamp
FROM
  `your_project.your_dataset.cloud_nat_logs`
WHERE
  JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.nat_ip') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
  timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100

Explanation:

	•	$.connection.src_ip: The internal source IP address before NAT.
	•	$.connection.dest_ip: The external destination IP address.
	•	$.connection.nat_ip: The NATed external IP address.
	•	$.connection.src_port and $.connection.dest_port: The source and destination ports.
	•	timestamp: The time the NAT translation occurred.

You can modify the query to filter based on specific internal or external IPs to trace their mapping over time.

5. Join with VPC Flow Logs (Optional)

To get a full view of the traffic, you can combine the Cloud NAT logs with VPC Flow Logs using a SQL JOIN in BigQuery. This allows you to correlate network flows from VMs with their NAT translations.

Example Query to Combine NAT Logs and VPC Flow Logs

WITH nat_logs AS (
  SELECT
    JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.src_ip') AS internal_ip,
    JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.nat_ip') AS external_ip,
    JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.dest_ip') AS destination_ip,
    timestamp
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.cloud_nat_logs`
  WHERE
    JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.connection.nat_ip') IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
  vpc_log.src_ip AS internal_ip,
  vpc_log.dest_ip AS destination_ip,
  nat_logs.external_ip AS nat_ip,
  vpc_log.src_port AS source_port,
  vpc_log.dest_port AS destination_port,
  vpc_log.timestamp AS flow_timestamp
FROM
  `your_project.your_dataset.vpc_flow_logs` AS vpc_log
JOIN
  nat_logs
ON
  vpc_log.src_ip = nat_logs.internal_ip
AND
  vpc_log.dest_ip = nat_logs.destination_ip
ORDER BY
  flow_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100

Explanation:

	•	This query joins the VPC Flow Logs and NAT logs on the internal source IP and destination IP, allowing you to trace internal IPs to their external NATed IPs and get detailed traffic data.
	•	The nat_logs subquery retrieves NAT translation data, and the main query joins it with VPC flow data.

6. Filtering and Analyzing Logs

Once you have the logs in BigQuery, you can:

	•	Filter by specific internal IPs (e.g., a specific VM or subnet).
	•	Identify which external IP address an internal resource was translated to.
	•	Analyze traffic patterns for specific external destinations.
	•	Export results for further analysis or monitoring.

7. Create Dashboards and Alerts

To keep track of IP translations in real-time:

	•	Export BigQuery results to Data Studio or use Cloud Monitoring to create dashboards and visualize traffic patterns.
	•	Set up alerts in Cloud Monitoring to notify you when certain IP mappings or traffic thresholds are reached.

Conclusion

By exporting Cloud NAT logs and VPC Flow Logs to BigQuery and running queries to trace internal and external IP addresses, you can effectively track the source of traffic before and after NAT. This process allows you to monitor and troubleshoot network flows in GCP, providing insight into which internal resources are responsible for outbound traffic and their corresponding external IPs.
